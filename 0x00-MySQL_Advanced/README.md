1. Creating Tables with Constraints

The tasks require creating tables with specific attributes and constraints using the CREATE TABLE statement.
Constraints enforce data integrity by defining rules that data must adhere to when inserted or updated in the table.
The scripts demonstrate using constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, DEFAULT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY. 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

The provided examples showcase inserting, updating, and deleting data from tables using the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements respectively.
These statements are crucial for managing and modifying data within the database. 3. Working with Enumerations

One of the tasks involves creating a table with an attribute that uses an enumeration (a predefined set of values).
This ensures data consistency and avoids typos when specifying allowed values. 4. Filtering and Selecting Data

The scripts demonstrate selecting specific data from tables using the SELECT statement with various clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT.
These clauses enable retrieving filtered and sorted results based on specific conditions. 5. Subqueries

Some examples involve using subqueries within the SELECT statement.
Subqueries are essentially nested queries that retrieve data used within the main query. 6. JOINs

The curriculum appears to cover different join types like INNER JOIN for retrieving related data from multiple tables based on a matching condition. 7. Functions and Expressions

The scripts demonstrate using built-in MySQL functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and mathematical operators to perform calculations and transformations on data. 8. Triggers

The tasks cover creating triggers, which are special database objects that automatically execute specific SQL statements (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in response to certain events (like inserting, updating, or deleting data in a table).
Triggers help enforce data integrity or automate specific actions within the database. 9. Stored Procedures

The curriculum introduces stored procedures, which are predefined SQL statements that can be executed by name with parameters.
Stored procedures promote code reusability, modularity, and security. 10. Views

Tasks include creating views, which are virtual tables based on a predefined SQL query.
Views simplify complex queries and provide a layer of abstraction for users. 11. Indexes

The curriculum covers creating indexes on table columns.
Indexes are data structures that speed up retrieval of specific data by allowing faster searching and filtering. 12. Error Handling

While not explicitly mentioned in the tasks, error handling is an essential aspect of working with databases.
The provided SQL code might not include explicit error handling mechanisms, but it's a recommended practice to incorporate proper error checking and handling for robust database interactions.
